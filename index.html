            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I've always had a fascination with technology. In late
                2023, I took a leap and began teaching myself coding to fulfill my creative urge to build. While I
                enjoyed
                the challenges and rewards of optometry, I craved a new way to channel my creativity. I discovered free
                online courses like CS50x and The Odin Project, and I was immediately captivated. Coding felt like
                electronic Lego—assembling pieces to create something functional and dynamic was incredibly satisfying.

                In 2024, my passion led me to enroll in a graduate certificate program at Deakin University, where I
                further
                developed my skills in web and game development. I'm proud to share my journey through my projects,
                which
                are listed from oldest to newest. Currently, I'm redesigning a website for a local pharmacy using
                Tailwind
                and React. Additionally, I'm diving into the challenge of creating a custom web-based dispensing system
                to
                address the shortcomings of the current software. I'm excited about the new skills and knowledge this
                journey will bring.
