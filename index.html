        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I have always enjoyed tinkering with all things technology. 
            In late 2023 I decided to teach myself coding as a way to satisfy my inner desire to build stuff. Optometry is great, you get
            to help people with their eyesight and health but I decided I needed a creative outlet. I found a few free courses online (CS50x and TheOdinProject) online and I was hooked! 
            How had I never stumbled upon coding before? It was like electronic lego- building something piece by piece and watching it do stuff is so satisfying. 

            Fast forward to 2024 I enrolled in a graduate certificate at Deakin University and this fuelled my passion further. I developed a passion for game and web development.
