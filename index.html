            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Thanks for visiting my website. It is currently under construction. I've gone for a clean minimalist design so the focus remains on my projects. </p>
            <p>
                I've always had a fascination with technology. In late
                2023, I took a leap and began teaching myself coding to fulfill my creative urge to build. 
            </p>

            <p>
                In 2024, my new found passion led me to enroll in a graduate certificate program at Deakin University, where I
                further
                developed my skills in C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and SQL. I'm proud to share my journey through my projects,
                which
                are listed from oldest to newest. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I am also working on a new game using C#/Unity and a small project to learn how to use React. I will post this projects up soon.
