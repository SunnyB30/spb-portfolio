            <p>I made this pretty simple game during my time at uni as a final project for an object oriented
                programming unit.
                I used C# with SplashKit- an open source SDK developed in Melbourne. It was an ambitious project at the
                time given that I was just a beginner to object oriented programming.
                It was satisfying to use both the inbuilt physics of SplashKit but also develop my own from scratch.
                Some of the features I implemented were a play button, ability to pick up move and place
                spaceships, automatic firing, automatic enemy detection within a range, various types of enemies, enemy
                damage and scoring system. The game itself only plays one round on one map and ends in either a win or
                loss for the player.
                I wont finish this game but will take what I have learnt here and have a go with the Unity dev platform
                next to create another game.
            </p>
            <p>
                I used some freely available game assets at this brilliant <a href="https://kenney.nl/"
                    target="_blank">site.</a> And I created the background myself using Adobe Express.
            </p>
            <p>Although you cant play the game, you can check out the video below that showcases a demo of the gameplay
                and running through the source. Please excuse my voice I had COVID at the time!</p>
